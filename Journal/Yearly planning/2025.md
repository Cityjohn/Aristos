## Mission and priorities
<small>(Write one sentence that captures what this year is fundamentally about. Then list 3–5 priorities across the key areas of your life — work, health, relationships, finances, personal growth. These should be broad enough to guide decisions all year, not just tasks.)</small>
<hr>

This year is about building the foundation — creating stable income from my own work, getting physically consistent, and deepening the relationships that matter most.

- **Work**: Launch and stabilize one primary income stream to replace freelance patchwork
- **Health**: Build a sustainable exercise and sleep routine — consistency over intensity
- **Relationships**: Invest more deliberately in close friendships and family; less shallow socializing
- **Finances**: Build a 3-month emergency fund and automate savings
- **Personal growth**: Read 12 books and spend less time consuming, more time creating

## Milestones 
<small>(Name 4–8 specific, concrete checkpoints that would tell you the year was a success. Each milestone should be something you can clearly say "done" or "not done" to. Assign a rough target quarter to each one.)</small>
<hr>

- First paying client for the new business — Q1
- Consistent exercise 3x/week for 8 consecutive weeks — Q1
- Emergency fund at 1 month of expenses — Q2
- Revenue covers baseline monthly costs — Q2
- Emergency fund at 3 months of expenses — Q4
- 12 books read — Q4
- One meaningful trip or experience with close family or friends — Q3

## Reverse goal setting 
<small>(Pick your most important milestone and work backwards from it. Ask: what has to be true one month before? One quarter before? What skills, resources, habits, or relationships need to be in place? What is the single biggest thing that could prevent it? List the dependencies in reverse order.)</small>
<hr>

**Target milestone**: Revenue covers baseline monthly costs by end of Q2.

Working backwards:
- By end of Q2: 3+ paying clients, repeatable delivery process in place
- One month before (May): at least 2 clients, clear service offering, pricing confirmed
- By end of Q1: first client signed, offer validated, outreach habit established (5+ contacts/week)
- By end of Jan: niche and offer defined, simple website or landing page live, first outreach sent
- Right now: decide on the niche — this is the single decision that unlocks everything else

Biggest blocker: spending time on building and refining instead of talking to potential clients early. The offer gets validated by people, not by more planning.
