## Mission and priorities
<small>(Define core intentions for the day and list the priorities to drive focus. Start with one clear sentence: "My mission today is to...". Then list 2–4 bullet priorities. Check yesterday's end-of-day review before writing — did anything carry over?)</small>
<hr>

My mission today is to finish the project proposal and send it to the client before the afternoon meeting.

- Draft and finalize the proposal document
- Prepare three talking points for the meeting
- Clear outstanding emails so the inbox is at zero by noon

Yesterday's note flagged that I kept putting off the proposal — today that is the first thing I open.

## Time and metrics
<small>(Outline the Duration-Path-Outcome of the mission to reduce uncertainty and boost motivation. Be specific: how many hours do you have, what is the exact sequence of steps, and what does "done" look like?)</small>
<hr>

I have 4 hours before the meeting. Sequence: 1) write proposal draft (90 min), 2) review and edit (30 min), 3) send to client (5 min), 4) prepare talking points (30 min), 5) clear inbox (30 min). Done means the proposal is in the client's inbox and I walk into the meeting prepared.

## End of day review
<small>(Do not skip this section — it is the most important one. Answer each briefly: What are you grateful for today? What distracted you or got in the way? What did you actually complete vs. plan? What will you do differently tomorrow? Rate your mood and energy 1–10.)</small>
<hr>

Grateful for: the client responded positively and the meeting went well. A good reminder that preparation pays off.

Distracted by: checked social media twice during the draft — cost me about 60 minutes and broke my flow both times.

Completed vs. planned: proposal sent ✓, meeting prep ✓, inbox zero ✗ (got to 5 emails, not zero).

Tomorrow: phone in another room during focused work blocks. Finish inbox first thing.

Mood: 7/10 — productive morning, slight energy dip after the meeting. Energy: 6/10.
