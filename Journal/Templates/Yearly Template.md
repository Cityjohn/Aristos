## Mission and priorities
<small>(Write one sentence that captures what this year is fundamentally about. Then list 3–5 priorities across the key areas of your life — work, health, relationships, finances, personal growth. These should be broad enough to guide decisions all year, not just tasks.)</small>
<hr>


## Milestones 
<small>(Name 4–8 specific, concrete checkpoints that would tell you the year was a success. Each milestone should be something you can clearly say "done" or "not done" to. Assign a rough target quarter to each one.)</small>
<hr>


## Reverse goal setting 
<small>(Pick your most important milestone and work backwards from it. Ask: what has to be true one month before? One quarter before? What skills, resources, habits, or relationships need to be in place? What is the single biggest thing that could prevent it? List the dependencies in reverse order.)</small>
<hr>
