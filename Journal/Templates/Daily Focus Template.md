## Mission and priorities
<small>(Define core intentions for the day and list the priorities to drive focus. Start with one clear sentence: "My mission today is to...". Then list 2–4 bullet priorities. Check yesterday's end-of-day review before writing — did anything carry over?)</small>

## Time and metrics
<small>(Outline the Duration-Path-Outcome of the mission to reduce uncertainty and boost motivation. Be specific: how many hours do you have, what is the exact sequence of steps, and what does "done" look like?)</small>
<hr>


## End of day review
<small>(Do not skip this section — it is the most important one. Answer each briefly: What are you grateful for today? What distracted you or got in the way? What did you actually complete vs. plan? What will you do differently tomorrow? Rate your mood and energy 1–10.)</small>
