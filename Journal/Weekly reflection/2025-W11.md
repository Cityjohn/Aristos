## End of week review
<small>(Before writing, skim your daily notes from this week. Summarize what actually happened — wins, distractions, emotional moments, and energy patterns. End with a short "Concise summary:" block of 3–5 bullet points.)</small>
<hr>

This week started strong — Monday and Tuesday I was focused and hit my priorities early. Wednesday was a write-off: an unexpected personal situation took up most of the afternoon and I never recovered momentum. Thursday I was running on low energy and defaulted to easy low-value tasks instead of the important ones. Friday I managed to close out the week's main deliverable, but it felt rushed.

The emotional pattern this week: stress from the unexpected Wednesday situation bled into Thursday even though the situation itself was resolved. Worth noticing that one disruption can cost two days if I don't consciously reset.

Energy was high Mon–Tue, crashed Wed–Thu, partial recovery Fri.

Concise summary:
- Strong start, lost mid-week to an unexpected disruption
- Tendency to fill low-energy days with easy tasks instead of rest or reset
- Main deliverable shipped but felt rushed at the end
- Emotional spillover cost more time than the actual event
- Need a better "reset protocol" for disrupted days

Next week I want to protect the morning blocks more strictly — no meetings before 11am if possible. When a disruption happens, I'll add a 15-minute "reentry" note to my daily file to consciously decide what to do with the rest of the day instead of drifting.

I'll also move the most important task to first thing in the morning so that even a bad afternoon still means the day wasn't wasted.

Concise summary:
- No meetings before 11am
- Add a "reentry" note after any disruption
- Most important task goes first every morning
- Low-energy afternoons get rest or admin, not fake productivity
- Review this note on Monday morning before writing the daily
